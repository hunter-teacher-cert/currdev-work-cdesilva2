Come up with an idea for a new computer science course that you would teach at your current school.
General description of the course
Target audience 
Whwre it fits along with the other courses in your school
I currently teach at MS319 - Maria Teresa Mirabal. Our school has recently started offering computer science. We partnered with CS4ALL to implement the different courses into student curriculum. We currently offer Computer Science Literacy, Typing, and Web Design. Here I have taught Typing and Web Design. For typing and computer science literacy we used code.org and for web design we used the creative web blueprint from CS4ALL.
