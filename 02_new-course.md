For typing and computer science literacy we used code.org and for web design we used the creative web blueprint from CS4ALL.
Students would use this course to help them develop their knowledge of computer science and get a feel for syntax. This course should be use to  develp syntax and highlight topics that will be prevelant in any computer language. These topics are the ones used and
