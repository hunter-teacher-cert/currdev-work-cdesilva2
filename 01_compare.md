Focus on the following:
Major Differences
Major Similiarities 
Comparitive strengths and weakness
Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?

When looking at Scratch I created and comparing to the pre-packaged cirriculum created by Hardvard Graduates it was interesting to see the lessons that they focused on and the pace of their lessons. Their lessons were created using more reflective elements by having students journaling and discussing ideas and less coding. When looking at similarities both lessons involved students partnering at different times to discuss coding and working together. Coding tends to be a highly colaborative field where students are able to learn and work from each other. When looking at the pre-packaged versions it was code to know that MIT and Harvard grads worked on this cirriuculum to incorporate scratch into computer science. I would of expected more elements of coding and less reflection. I definietly see the use in reflecting and would use it in my lessons but to a lesser extent.
