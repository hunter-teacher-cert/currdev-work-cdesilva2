Pick 2 specific NY CS standards and describe a lesson/task/assignment that addresses your selected standards, explain how.
You can use the same lesson/task/assignment for both, or different ones.

Standards
7-8.IC.4 Identify and discuss issues related to the collection and use of public and private data. 
7-8.IC.6 Assess the accessibility of a computing device or software application in terms of user needs.

Lesson: When looking at Standard 7-8.IC.4, I would design a lesson that is related to the collection and use of public and private data when looking at 2-step verification. 
Recently the doe has updated the email where a 2-step verification is required to ensure that data breaches does not occur. 
I would like the students to discuss the benefits and the negative impacts where they create a T-chart to track this within their group setting. 
Focusing in one a relatable use like student email and showing them on the screen what this looks like. The Doe may adopt this approach for students as well.
After students have created their T-chart, when looking at 7-8.IC.6, I would like them now to think about accessinility of the 2-step verification for users and what barriers 
or challenges this may possed for students with Special Needs.  The second standard is important to explore as it helps the student access their
higher order thinking when looking at data collection and what that might actually do to the user comfortability. Yes it makes the application safer 
but what is the appropriate trade off between user accessibility and user saftey?
